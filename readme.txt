== Considerations ==

= Internet Explorer Compatibility =
For various reasons, WP New Angle does not officially support IE8-10 - although the theme should technically work fine IE9+ (with a few bugs). I've made this decision based on:

1. From January 2016 - Microsoft is only supporting (technical support and security updates)
  "the most recent version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system".

  This means essentially (but don't quote me) that:
  - IE 11 will be the supported browser for all PCs and devices running Windows 7, Windows 8.x, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012 R2
  - Microsoft Edge with be the supported browser for Windows 10

2. From AngularJS 1.3 support for IE8 was dropped. AngularJS 1.3+ "will attempt to fix bugs for IE9 and above. The continuous integration server runs all the tests against IE9, IE10, and IE11"

3. I wanted to create a theme future proof, for long-term use, it is 2015 Q2 and the technology world (even Microsoft - fingers crossed) is moving past IE quirks.
